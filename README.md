1. describing your idea

Python pytrends can bring a Google Trends data.
So, at first, after printing the data for one day from 2015,
it was transferred to the csv file,
and then the same weekly data was printed until 2022 and then transferred to the csv file.




2. the amount of time you spent on finishing the program code

approximately 1.5 hours.




3. the different ways you have tried to approach the TECH ASSESSMENT

First of all, it wasn't work well so I tried searching google to get some logic to understand the problems then
found some document to fix the problems.




4. the reasons of settling on the current approach

I feel like these codes are easiest and shortest code to understand because the longer the code, the more disadvantageous it is to the programmer.




5. how to execute your program.

python3 dailydata.py 
python3 weeklydata.py
